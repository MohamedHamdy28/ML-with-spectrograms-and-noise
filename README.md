# ML-with-spectrograms-and-noise

In this assignment you will have to train CNN models to solve binary classification problems. Your input data is spectrograms generated from audio files. Main purpose of the assignment is to extend your dataset using noise generators, filtering and other techniques you find useful.

So, I applied some noises and augmentations.
